# BACKLOG

Items for future implementation. These are human-entered ideas not yet reflected
in the codebase.

## GPU / ROCm

- Add ROCm version pinning to opentofu variables (currently hardcoded as 7.2.3).
- Add GPU memory utilization monitoring script.
- Add automatic model eviction when GPU memory is low.
- Support multi-GPU workloads (future hardware upgrade).

## Model Management

- Add model versioning system (pin specific GGUF files per deployment).
- Add model download progress tracking and resume support.
- Add model quality scoring after inference testing.
- Support speculative decoding for faster inference (requires llama.cpp config changes).

## LXC Lifecycle

- Add LXC snapshot before major model updates.
- Add LXC health check endpoint in configure script.
- Add automatic LXC restart on crash (systemd watchdog).
- Add LXC resource quota enforcement (CPU, memory, I/O).

## Ansible Improvements

- Add ansible-lint to CI workflow.
- Split configure-ai-engine-inside-lxc.sh into multiple Ansible roles.
- Add idempotency tests for ansible playbook.
- Add ansible-galaxy role packaging for reuse.

## OpenTofu

- Add tofu variables for GPU PCI IDs (currently hardcoded).
- Add tofu output for container IP and API endpoint.
- Add tofu state locking for multi-operator safety.
- Migrate from telmate/proxmox to bpg/proxmox provider (align with hlh-docker).

## Networking

- Add DNS entry for engine API endpoint.
- Add HTTPS/TLS termination on nginx reverse proxy.
- Add rate limiting configuration for API endpoints.
- Add API key authentication for external consumers.

## Observability

- Add Prometheus metrics endpoint for inference latency.
- Add structured logging for llama-server.
- Add health check endpoint for orchestration.
- Add request logging with model name and token count.

## Deployment

- Add pre-flight checks for GPU availability before deployment.
- Add dry-run / plan mode for deploy script.
- Add rollback procedure for failed deployments.
- Add CI checks for shell scripts (shellcheck).
